# VBA-Whatsapp-Bot
This Excel allows send massive messages to Whatsapp with a attachment. 


'-----------------Considerations---------------------------------------------------
The WhatsApp application for PC must be downloaded. Link: https://www.whatsapp.com/download/
The way to send the attachment is done through actions with the Mouse,
so if or if the macro should run the WhatsApp application in the foreground

--- NOTE: You must have the WhatsApp application in full screen
The way it works for me is by opening the Whatsapp app and then minimizing it before running the macro

The Macro have TimeWaits, if you want, you can change the TimeWaits, I used 1 or 2 seconds
