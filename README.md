# VBA-Whatsapp-Bot
NOTE: This is only educational, avoid sending messages to many people

This Excel allows send massive messages to Whatsapp with a attachment only with Windows


'-----------------Considerations---------------------------------------------------
The WhatsApp application for PC must be downloaded. Link: https://www.whatsapp.com/download/
The way to send the attachment is done through actions with the Mouse,
so the macro must run the WhatsApp application in the foreground.

--- NOTE: You must have the WhatsApp application in full screen
The way it works for me is by opening the Whatsapp app and then minimizing it before running the macro. 
It is important that you always do this

The Macro have TimeWaits, if you want, you can change the TimeWaits, I used 1 or 2 seconds

VIDEO: You can see my video explaining the process (The video is in Spanish)
